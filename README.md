Polaroid for your code ðŸ“¸.

![usage](https://github.com/octref/polacode/raw/master/demo/usage.gif)

By [Pine](https://github.com/octref) & [Peng](https://github.com/rebornix) from VS Code team.
Happy Coding!

## Why?

You have spent countless hours finding the perfect [JavaScript grammar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=javascript%20grammar&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance), matching it with a [sleek-looking VS Code theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=VSCode&category=Themes&sortBy=Downloads), trying out all the [best programming fonts](https://www.slant.co/topics/67/~best-programming-fonts).

You take three days porting over [your theme](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2-vscode) before starting to use VS Code.
You shell out $200 for italic cursive html attributes.

The code has to look right.

## Seriously, why not just take a screenshot?

- I like and care about the shadow, padding & rounded corner of macOS's screenshot. I want it to be available for my code snippet too. You can't select a part of your code and easily get all these nice visuals with macOS's Grab tool.
- I want to hide errors, warnings, color decorators, folding markers, line numbers, scrollbar and minimap.
- It generates something decent on Windows & Linux.

## Tip

- If you have the Vim extension, remove its keybinding for copying. Otherwise VS Code won't copy code with syntax highlighting. Alternatively you can run the command `Copy with Syntax Highlighting`.
- When running out of horizontal space, try the command `View: Toggle Editor Group Vertical/Horizontal Layout`.
